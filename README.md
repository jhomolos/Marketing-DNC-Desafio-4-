<b>Marketing Strategies in a Marketing Company</b>

<b>Disclaimer</b>: This project was carried out and completed during Data Science course at the Escola DNC, Brazil.

<b>Business Understanding</b>

A company is investing monthly in online advertising platforms, such as Youtube, Facebook and newspaper, to prospect for leads (people interested in its products). In order to monitor the performance of these investments, the company records all advertising spending and all sales returns generated from these investments.
In order to better understand the relationship between the variables in these records and identify the factors that have the greatest impact on lead generation, the company asked a data specialist to analyze them. In addition, the company is looking to create a value prediction model to estimate the return on sales that can be generated from a given investment in advertising.
Here, the knowledge learned in the Data Science course will be used to structure an analysis of a marketing campaign dataset using the Linear Regression technique.
